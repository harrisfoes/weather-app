## Weather-app
A simple weather app to practice fetching data from an API
URL:

## About
This is a Weather forecast app where you can search for the current weather for any location around the world.

## Lessons Applied
- How to use an external API
- Async / Await JavaScript

## Tech
- JavaScript, basic HTML/CSS, webpack

## My Thoughts
- The async and await concepts aren't something you'll likely understand just by reading through the material. Even the external tutorials I looked into left me confused. I would advise other learners to dive into the code immediately and experiment around. In essence, Async and Await functionality asks you to wait for data delivery from an external service. You'll have to write the code in such a way that it accomodates for the time it takes to retrieve your data. Handling of errors is beyond the scope but we'll probably have to dive into that sooner or later.

## To Do:
- [x] setup blank HTML document with appropriate links
- [x] write the functions that hit the API.
- [x] take a location and return the weather on console
- [x] write the functions that process the JSON data
- [x] return an object with only the data required for 
 the app
- [x] data -> Location, 
- [x] setup a simple form that will let users input their location
- [x] display the information on the webpage
- [x] add styling
- [x] optional: add a loading component
- [x] use devtools for low-end devices
